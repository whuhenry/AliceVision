## Release 2.1.0 (2019.01.30)

Release Notes Summary:
 - More complete sensor database and better matching as well as explicit status for lens initialization
 - Add support for rig of cameras. This enables to add more contraints if you make acquisition with multiple synchronized devices.
 - Support for reconstruction with projected light patterns and texturing with another images set.
 - Better estimation of the space to reconstruct to limit the reconstruction zone. This avoid to reconstruct low quality and useless areas around the main object/environment.
 - New option to directly mesh the SfM results. This provides a quick solution to get a draft mesh (without cuda requirement).
 - Reduce IO and intermediate files in MVS part of the pipeline.

Full Release Notes:
 - sensorDB: Update the sensors database with much more models
 - sensorDB: Use `FocalLengthIn35mmFilm` metadata as a fallback if available
 - sensorDB: Improve matching of metadata make/model with sensor database
 - CameraInit: New management of intrinsics (serial number, error/warning log) with an explicit InstrinsicInitMode enum
 - CameraInit: Fix intrinsics grouping with serial number as expected and add metadata "AliceVision::SensorWidth"
               (or "AliceVision::SensorWidthEstimated" if estimated from `FocalLength`/`FocalLengthIn35mmFilm`)
 - CameraInit: Explicit warning if serial number is missing
 - SfM: Add support for rig of cameras. This information is used as a new constraint in the SfM. This option can now be combined with localBA.
        You need to use a specific folder hierarchy in the input images files (for instance: “/my/dataset/rig/0/DSLR_0001.JPG”, “/my/dataset/rig/1/DSLR_0001.JPG”) to provide this information.
 - PrepareDenseScene: New `imagesFolders` option to override input images. This enables to use images with light patterns projected for SfM and MVS parts
                      and do the Texturing with another set of images.
 - Meshing fusion: New option to use SfM landmarks (mesh from sparse point cloud) or combine them with depth maps
 - Meshing: Add option `estimateSpaceFromSfM` to better estimate the bounding box of the reconstruction and avoid useless reconstruction of the environment
 - MVS: Reduce IO and intermediate files. Use sfmData in the MVS pipeline (instead of MVS seeds, ini file) and do not export depthmap files before refine
 - ExportAnimatedCamera: Improved solution to export an SfM result into an animated camera
 - PrepareDenseScene: Remove hackish software `CameraConnection` (now properly done in PrepareDenseScene)
 - PrepareDenseScene: Allow parallelization on renderfarm
 - FeatureExtraction: Add grid filtering in AKAZE (to avoid unmanageable number of keypoints on well textured images)
 - DepthMap: Fix memory leak in SGMVolume
 - Meshing: Fix loading of OBJ with normals
 - System: Improve gpu detection and logging
 - DepthMap: Enable usage of multiple GPUs by default with an option to add a limit
 - DepthMap: Fuse estimate & refine in a single loop (fuse “computeDepthMapsPSSGM” with “refineDepthMaps”)  and use the same image cache
 - DepthMap: Remove depthMapInfo files and use image metadata instead
 - DepthMap: Initial refactoring for better readability to prepare the optimization work
 - SfM: Refactoring of localBA (now fused with the standard BA code to avoid redundancy)
 - ConvertSfMFormat: Users can now specify a view whitelist to filter views
 - SfM: The user can provide only one image of the initial pair and it will choose the 2nd image automatically.
        This allows to ensure that the reconstruction start from a specific part of the scene without choosing the image pair manually.
 - SfMTransform: Allow to choose one view as the origin for the coordinate system
 - SfM Augmentation from known poses: When the sfm starts with existing cameras poses but without landmarks, it now does the triangulation first.
 - LightingEstimation: New module with preliminary low-level methods for lighting estimation (spherical harmonics)
 - MeshDenoising: Fix ignored parameter denoising outer iteration
 - Meshing: Bug fix (infinity loop) in Meshing when the BBox is empty
 - SfM LocalBA: reduce minimum number of images to use sparse BA (change threshold from 100 to 20) to speedup large reconstructions when localBA is used.
 - Minor build fix for compatibility with ceres 2.
